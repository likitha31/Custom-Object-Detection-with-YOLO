        "# Assignment: Custom Object Detection with YOLO\n",
        "\n",
        "## Goal\n",
        "In this assignment, you will create a custom object detection model using YOLO. You will select an object to detect, build a dataset, label the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance. This project will provide hands-on experience in data collection, model training, and evaluation—essential skills in machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Select an Object to Detect\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Choose an Object\n",
        "Select a simple, easily recognizable object such as an apple, cup, pen, or bicycle.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Goal\n",
        "The goal is to create a dataset that will help YOLO detect this object in images with different backgrounds, angles, and lighting conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Tip\n",
        "Choose an object that you can easily find and photograph, as this will simplify the dataset-building process.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Collect and Label Data\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Purpose\n",
        "The purpose of this step is to create a well-labeled dataset that YOLO can use to learn to detect your chosen object.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Instructions\n",
        "Collect 50–100 images of your object, focusing on variety. Capture images from different angles, with different lighting, and at various distances. Start with this smaller set, adding more images only if needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Image Variety\n",
        "- **Angles:** Capture your object from different viewpoints (e.g., front, side, top).\n",
        "- **Distances:** Include both close-up and distant shots to help YOLO recognize the object at different scales.\n",
        "- **Lighting:** Take pictures in various lighting conditions (e.g., natural light, low light).\n",
        "- **Backgrounds:** Use different backgrounds so that YOLO can detect the object regardless of the surroundings.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Labeling the Data\n",
        "Label each image by drawing a bounding box around the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Tools\n",
        "Use [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) or [Makesense.ai](https://www.makesense.ai/).\n",
        "\n",
        "##### How to Label\n",
        "1. Open each image in the labeling tool.\n",
        "2. Draw a bounding box around the object.\n",
        "3. Save the label in YOLO format. Each image should have a corresponding text file with the same name as the image (e.g., `image1.jpg` and `image1.txt`).\n",
        "\n",
        "##### YOLO Format Explained\n",
        "The YOLO format is a text file containing the object’s class ID and bounding box coordinates. The class ID tells YOLO which object it is detecting (use `0` if you’re detecting only one object type). Bounding box coordinates specify the box’s position, which YOLO uses to learn object location.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Optional - Auto-Labeling Tools\n",
        "To save time, use auto-labeling tools like [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) or [Supervisely](https://supervise.ly/).\n",
        "\n",
        "###### How Auto-Labeling Works\n",
        "These tools use pre-trained models to detect common objects and automatically draw bounding boxes around them.\n",
        "\n",
        "###### Review Needed\n",
        "Check each auto-labeled image to ensure the boxes are accurate and make small adjustments if necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "###### Export in YOLO Format\n",
        "Both Roboflow and Supervisely allow you to export your labeled dataset in YOLO format.\n"

        "### 3. Organize Your Data\n",
        "\n",
        "After collecting and labeling your images, it's crucial to organize the dataset so that YOLO can use it effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Folder Structure\n",
        "Create folders to store your images and labels in a way that YOLO can process.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Create two main folders named `images` and `labels`.**\n",
        "2. **Inside each folder, create subfolders: `train`, `val` (for validation), and `test`.**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Data Split\n",
        "Divide your images into the following proportions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Train (70%):** Used to train the model. This subset should be the largest to provide ample examples for learning.\n",
        "- **Validation (20%):** Used to tune model parameters. This helps to moderate the training process and prevent overfitting.\n",
        "- **Test (10%):** Used to test the model’s final performance. This set is crucial for evaluating how well your model generalizes to new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Efficiency Tip\n",
        "For images with similar scenes, you can copy bounding boxes from one image to another and adjust them. This method saves time compared to redrawing each box from scratch. Efficient labeling is key, especially when dealing with large datasets or when you need to make slight adjustments to similar images.\n"
